Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

Extra:


import random


def main():
    characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~"
    password =  ''.join(random.choice(characters)for x in range(0,10))
    print(password)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
